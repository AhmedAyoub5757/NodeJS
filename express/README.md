# 🚀 Express.js Learning Roadmap  

This repository documents my journey of learning **Express.js**, one of the most popular web frameworks for Node.js.  
Each topic is explained in **theory-first style** with comparisons, notes, and examples.  

---

## 📌 Why Express.js?  

- Built on top of **Node.js HTTP module**.  
- Provides **simpler APIs** for routing, file handling, and middleware.  
- Reduces **boilerplate code** while still giving full control.  
- Industry standard for building **backend web servers and APIs**.

## 📖 Learning Strategy  

- Start with **theory** → understand concepts deeply.  
- Practice with **minimal code snippets**.  
- Build **small demos per topic**.  
- At the end, combine all into a **real-world Express project**.  

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways  

- Express is **HTTP + shortcuts + structure**.  
- Environment variables are **essential for security**.  
- File handling is **simpler and cleaner** than raw HTTP.  
- Roadmap builds from **basics → advanced concepts → project-ready skills**.
